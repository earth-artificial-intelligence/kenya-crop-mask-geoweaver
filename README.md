# kenya-crop-mask-geoweaver

This workflow is generated by Geoweaver to replicate and preserve the experiments done by University of Maryland in Kenya crop mapping experiment. 

**NOTE**: The [`data.zip`](https://github.com/earth-artificial-intelligence/kenya-crop-mask-geoweaver/releases/download/v1.0.5/data.zip) attached with `Release v1.0.5` is required to have this workflow work. Please move the unzipped folder `data/` to geoweaver's workspace folder (i.e., `gw-workspace/`). Both the imported workflow and `data/` folder should be on the same directory level within `gw-workspace/`
